## Introduction

>University Share, or US for short, is a web application created by students from the computing department of the IUT of Bayonne to help us centralize our file-sharing system. We realized that we were all sharing documents on different platforms. It made it quite time-consuming trying to find what had been sent where and by whom. So we thought we should create a platform where we could all share our documents; a place where our resources are organized by semester and module, making it extremely easy to find everything you need. Our platform’s main goal is to promote sharing and helping each other out. To encourage students to participate, we decided to implement a ranking functionality. Each user can mark another’s contribution out of 5. Depending on how well your contributions are marked and how many you post, you get a certain number of points. The 10 users with the most points make up the current top 10.
